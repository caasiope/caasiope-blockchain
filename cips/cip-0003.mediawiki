==Abstract==
The new account type vending machine allows to automatically exchange a currency for another, at a rate fixed by the owner.

==Motivation==
The protocol already supports multi-currency transactions but another channel must be used to negociate and sign the exchange transaction, this proposal would handle the most frequent uses cases.

==Specification==

===Declaration===

A new declaration type is introduced :
* VendingMachine : 0x4


===Verification===

===Protocol Version===
A new protocol version is introduced :
* VendingMachine : 0x3

==Rationale==
The rate is used only to divide, so we dont have overflow;

==Backwards compatibility==
This proposal introduces a new account type.
Backwards compatibility is ok.
Forwards compatibility is not possible, old versions are going to reject anything with the new account type.
